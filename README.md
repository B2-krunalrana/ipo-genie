IPO Genie simplifies investing in Indian IPOs through real-time updates and insights. The project includes data scraping and cleaning to ensure accurate market information, combined with UI/UX improvements for a seamless user experience. Built using Python for data processing, React Native for app development, and Flask/Django for the backend.


⚠️ Note: This is currently a private library. I plan to make it open-source in the near future.
